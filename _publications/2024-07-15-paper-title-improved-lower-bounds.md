This paper was a result of the Major Qualifying Project of myself, Andrew Salls, and Chase Miller. You can find the preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10925), our full MQP report [here](https://digital.wpi.edu/concern/student_works/wh246x39h), and an accompanying website we created for teaching and exploring the Longest Common Subsequence problem more generally [here](https://statistics-of-subsequences.github.io/). This paper was the subject of a talk I gave at the Tufts University Discrete Math Seminar on August 8, 2024.
