### Page Currently Under Construction

I aim to complete this page by December 20, 2025. If you come across this page and it's not done by then, please feel free to send me a disappointed email.

I believe it is important for AI/ML researchers and practitioners to seriously evaluate their reasons for doing research, the impact (positive AND negative) they believe their work might have if it succeeds, and their perspective on the state of the field. On this page, I outline my own position, and I make an argument for why you should, too.

More broadly, I believe that we should encourage honest and open discourse about our motives and the direction of machine learning as a field. If you are a researcher or practitioner in ML, and if you have not done so already, I encourage you to take the time to sit down, write out your thoughts[^1], and (if you have a website) make them public.[^2]


### For Now...
While this page is under construction, I highly recommend watching [this talk](https://youtu.be/PngHcmMmwWI?si=QAn6I0JyNJlFVfVR) by Nicholas Carlini, especially if you work with LLMs.

I do not agree with absolutely everything in it, but on the whole I think it is a solid overview of why we should be conscientious about how advancing ML can cause damage. I hope to cover that aspect, as well as other concerns I have about the direction of the field as well as places I have hope.

You may also find [this quick read](https://colinraffel.com/blog/the-universal-third-person.html) interesting, even if you disagree with it.








[^1]: I think it goes without saying here, but please don't use an AI to do the thinking for you on this. Only you know your own motives and perspective. (Not to mention that doing that would [contribute to concentration of power](https://youtu.be/PngHcmMmwWI?t=1143).)

[^2]: I understand not everyone has the luxury to publicly air their opinions, but that just makes it that much more important that those of us who can, do.
