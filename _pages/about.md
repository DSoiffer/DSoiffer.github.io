Hi! I'm Duncan Soiffer, a 2024 - 2025 (December) Master's in Machine Learning student at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, I was an undergraduate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute from 2020-2024, where I majored in computer science and math. I am broadly interested in all aspects of machine learning, and especially interested in core methods.

I recently worked in [Professor Virginia Smith](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/)'s lab, where I led a project on extending agreement-based cascading to generative language tasks (where agreement is difficult to quantify). This resulted in a [paper](https://dsoiffer.github.io/publication/semantic-cascade) submitted to EMNLP.
Currently, I am working in [Professor Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/)'s lab on causal representation learning. On the side, I'm also experimenting with exploring inductive bias and the solution space of representation learning methods through a novel (but as-of-yet unproven) lens, and a project designing search algorithms for a constructive mathematical proof.

Besides this, I have previously worked on reinforcement learning, AI for science, agentic AI, and a cubesatellite. Out of all of my projects, I'm most proud of my Major Qualifying Project (undergraduate thesis) at WPI. Along with fellow undergraduates Andrew Salls and [Chase Miller](thecpmills.com), and supervised by Professors [Daniel Reichman](https://sites.google.com/view/danielreichman/home), [Gábor Sárközy](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gsarkozy/), and [George Heineman](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/heineman), we improved the best known lower bounds on the [Chvátal–Sankoff constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chv%C3%A1tal%E2%80%93Sankoff_constants) ([click here for our paper](https://dsoiffer.github.io/publication/chvatal-sankoff-constant)) and additionally created a [website](https://statistics-of-subsequences.github.io/) to help teach and explore the Longest Common Subsequence problem more generally.

(Fun fact: I have an Erdős number of 2!)
